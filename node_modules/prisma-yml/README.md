**Prisma - turn your database into a GraphQL API**. Prisma lets you design your data model and have a production ready [GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/) API online in minutes.

The Prisma GraphQL API provides powerful abstractions and building blocks to develop flexible, scalable GraphQL backends:

1. **Type-safe API** that can be used from frontend and backend, including filters, aggregations and transactions.
2. **Data modeling** with declarative SDL. Prisma migrates your underlying database automatically.
3. **Realtime API** using GraphQL Subscriptions.
4. **Advanced API composition** using GraphQL Bindings and schema stitching.
5. **Works with all frontend frameworks** like React, Vue.js, Angular ([Quickstart Examples](https://www.prismagraphql.com/docs/quickstart/)).

## Quickstart

[Watch this 4 min tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zGexpEitc) or follow the steps below to get started with Prisma:

1. **Install the CLI via NPM:**

```console
npm install -g prisma
```

2. **Create a new service:**

The following command creates all files you need for a new [service](https://www.prismagraphql.com/docs/reference/service-configuration/overview-ieshoo5ohm).

```console
prisma init
```

3. **Define your data model:**

Edit `datamodel.prisma` to define your data model using the [GraphQL SDL notation](<https://www.prismagraphql.com/docs/reference/service-configuration/data-modelling-(sdl)-eiroozae8u>).

```graphql
type Tweet {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  text: String!
  owner: User!
  location: Location!
}

type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  handle: String! @unique
  name: String
  tweets: [Tweet!]!
}

type Location {
  latitude: Float!
  longitude: Float!
}
```

5. **Deploy your service:**

To deploy your service simply run the following command and select one of the hosted development clusters or setup a local Docker-based development environment:

```console
prisma deploy
```

6. **Connect to your GraphQL endpoint:**

Use the endpoint from the previous step in your frontend (or backend) applications to connect to your GraphQL API.

7. **Read more in the dedicated quickstarts for your favorite technology**

## Architecture

Prisma is a secure API layer that sits in front of your database. Acting as a proxy, Prisma exposes a powerful GraphQL API and manages Rate-Limiting, Authentication, Logging and a host of other features. Because Prisma is a standalone process, it can be scaled independently from your application layer and provide scalable subscriptions infrastructure.

## GraphQL API

The most important component in Prisma is the GraphQL API:

- Query, mutate & stream data via GraphQL CRUD API
- Define and evolve your data model using GraphQL SDL

Try the online demo: [open GraphQL Playground](https://www.prismagraphql.com/features)
